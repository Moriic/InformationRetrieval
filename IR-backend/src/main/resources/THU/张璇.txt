概况 
Prof. Xuan Zhang received the B.Eng. degree in Automation from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree in Control and Electrical Engineering from the University of Oxford, Oxford, U.K., in 2015. From 2015 to 2018, he was a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Harvard Center for Green Buildings and Cities, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA. Since 2018, he has been with the Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute, Shenzhen, China, where he is currently an Associate Professor with the Smart Grid and Renewable Energy Laboratory. His current research interests include the control and optimization for cyber-physical systems (such as smart grids, smart buildings, and Energy Internet), control system structure (re)design, and learning-based control.
opening:
I am always looking for Ph.D. and Master students with strong backgrounds in Math (control theory, optimization), Computer Science (machine learning), and Electrical Engineering (power system, smart grid, Energy Internet).

<研究领域>
研究领域 
-- Cyber-physical systems: smart grids, smart/green buildings, Energy Internet, multi-agent systems, etc.
-- Modern control theory
-- Convex optimization
-- Learning, and learning-based control
主要项目 
-- Exploring the flexibility of distributed energy resources (renewable energy, distributed generation, controllable loads, etc.) and using AI-based techniques to aggregate them as virtual power plants to assist the operation of power grids and the general Energy Internet
-- Designing real-time distributed optimization and control frameworks for smart power networks, with blockchain based real-time autonomous market operating in parallel. The ultimate goal is to achieve real-time point-to-point energy trading for microgrids, distribution networks, etc., and extend those frameworks to the general Energy Internet
-- Using convex optimization/convex relaxation techniques to design controllers with certain structures for network systems, meanwhile, ensuring optimality, stability, robustness to disturbances and model uncertainties
-- Solar-battery related applications, energy storage system planning and operation
